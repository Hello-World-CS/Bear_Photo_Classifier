### About
In this project, a student has built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that identifies whether a specific animal is in a photo. The student built and cleaned a dataset of several hundred photos, and built a CNN classifier using Keras. After using test data to evaluate their modelsâ€™ performance, the student used their classifiers to identify animals in real-world trail camera videos.

### Project Outcome
This project could be used to identify, count, and track wildlife. Automating the collection of this highly valuable data could be tremendously helpful to research scientists. 

### Key Learnings
* How to build and train a convolutional neural network
* Building and cleaning large datasets 
* Using data to evaluate neural network performance
